# Cheerio

A fork of harryf's [node-soupselect](http://github.com/harryf/node-soupselect), which is originally a port of Simon Willison's [soupselect](http://code.google.com/p/soupselect/) for use with node.js and node-htmlparser.

## Installation

    $ npm install cheerio-soupselect

## Testing

From the root folder:

    $ mocha -u tdd -R list

## Why not just use node-soupselect?

Since soupselect hasn't been updated for 9 months, I decided to fork it and continue development in the context of cheerio. I plan to keep it stand-alone from cheerio, so you will be able to use it without using cheerio.
